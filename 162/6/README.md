Write a **recursive** function named array_max that takes as its parameter a list of numbers and returns the maximum value in the list.  You can assume the array contains at least one element.  If multiple elements of the array are tied for the maximum, you would still return that value.

You may use default arguments and/or helper functions.

The file must be named: **array_max.py**
