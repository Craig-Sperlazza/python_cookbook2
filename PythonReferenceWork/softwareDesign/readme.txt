principle 1: flexibility and resuability--see flexibilit.py
principle 2: seperation of concerns---see guessNum.py
principle 3: cohesiveness ----cohesivness folder
    in folder we have list functionm in one file, hash table functions in a second.
    they are cohesive, we import what we need
    We will also create a package---folder full of python modules
        to do so we create a folder (util) and inside that folder we need __init__.py
            this file tells python we are initializing this package and we can import all the modules (files) at once
