# project-4d

Write a bubble sort that counts the number of comparisons and the number of exchanges made while sorting a list and returns a tuple of the two values (comparisons first, exchanges second).  Do the same for insertion sort.  Name these functions **bubble_count** and **insertion_count**.  

Try sorting various lists with both functions.  What do you notice about the number of comparisons and exchanges made for lists of different sizes?  What do you notice for lists that are nearly sorted vs. lists that are nearly reversed?  You don't need to submit your observations, just the functions.

The file must be named: **sorts_count.py**
