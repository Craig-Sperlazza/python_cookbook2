# project-4b

Write a Box class whose init method takes three parameters and uses them to initialize the length, width and height of a Box.  It should also have a method named volume that returns the volume of the Box.  Write a function named box_sort (not part of the Box class) that uses insertion sort to sort a list of Boxes from greatest volume to least volume.

The file must be named: **box_sort.py**
